The DST-showcase-repo is a repository for keeping showcase images and posters for the Data Science and Technology department.

Images and posters are placed in the main trunk.

To add captions for an image, create a text file in captions/ with the same name as the image and append the .txt extension. For example, for an image foo.jpg, its corresponding caption would have the path name captions/foo.jpg.txt
